# Questions they will ask:

#### What is the concept (what is iLost) ?

- final concept document answers this question, please make sure you've read it well !
  - [concept - pls read me](final-concept.md)

- talk about our unique protocol:

  In a long range situation, when the user gets closer to the tracker. The smartphone app tells the tracker to turn on the Bluetooth module. The smartphone then measures the bluetooth signal strength, the stronger the signal, the closer the user is to the tracker. (the cellular modem is switched off to save battery) This increase the trackers location accuracy, espicially in an urban environment. 


#### What is the market for the concept ?

•	Don’t forget an item reminder, app adapts to users need

•	Long-range & Short-range Asset tracking indoors & outdoors

•	Air & Sea Shipment tracking

•	Vehicle tracking (where you parked your car, recover stolen car etc..)


#### what role did the conceptual prototype have in the project ?
// add answer here - (hussein: i don't know how to answer this)


#### what influence did stakeholder feedback have in the project ?
// add answer here - (hussein: i don't know how to answer this)


####  What role did the functional prototype have in the project ?
// add answer here - i will answer this
• we went through 10 different tecnologies to reach point were we are now:
  • [hardware reaserch](hardware-research.md)
  
• singular approaches evoled into a hybrid approach we have now
  
• we evaluted all the advantages and disadvantages of the technologies listed in [hardware reaserch document](hardware-research.md) at each technology assesed wether this technology could fulfil the use cases.

• the functional protoyping is what made our product iLost evolve to reach a point where its unique compared to our competitors (it exclusively uses cellular for long range and bluetooth at short range) 


#### - What technical architecture and technology will be used to realise the project ?
