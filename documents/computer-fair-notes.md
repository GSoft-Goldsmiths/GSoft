# Questions they will ask:

#### What is the concept (what is iLost) ?

- final concept document answers this question, please make sure you've read it well !
  - GSoft/documents/final-concept.md

- talk about our unique protocol:

  In a long range situation, when the user gets closer to the tracker. The smartphone app tells the tracker to turn on the Bluetooth module. The smartphone then measures the bluetooth signal strength, the stronger the signal, the closer the user is to the tracker. (the cellular modem is switched off to save battery) This increase the trackers location accuracy, espicially in an urban environment. 


#### What is the market for the concept ?

•	Don’t forget an item reminder, app adapts to users need

•	Long-range & Short-range Asset tracking indoors & outdoors

•	Air & Sea Shipment tracking

•	Vehicle tracking (where you parked your car, recover stolen car etc..)
