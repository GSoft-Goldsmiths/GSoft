# Market Research

I’ve collected the following data going through the actual product websites and other tech related websites as well as going through customer reviews on amazon and google reviews from users who purchased and used these products.

Following items work better in densely populated places like cities.


## [TILE](https://www.thetileapp.com/en-gb)

* [Reviews on Tech Advisor](http://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/second-generation-tile-review-bluetooth-tag-3575574/)


### PROS: 
* waterproof (splashes and rain)
* small design
* works via crowdsourcing. (Tiles communicate with one another, effectively having other users helping you find what you've lost)
* Track last location
* Ring the alarm things that has the tile on.

### CONS: 
* Only iOS
* $19.95/ £20 maybe a little overpriced
* Non-replaceable battery
* Estimated to last a year, but many customers complains lasting no more than 6 months.
* Privacy invasive software 
* Company can and will use the demographic information it collects on you in any way it wants including sharing it with partners. 
* Company can find out where you eat, go church, jog and so on.
* Anyone else who has app, and is near you, will report your location through their phone

### What can be improved?
* Decrease the price range perhaps.
* Increase ring volume 
* Use a bigger battery 
* Fix privacy problems


## [TrackR Bravo / StickR / TrackR](https://www.thetrackr.com)

### PROS
* Available for both iOS and Android
* Small design
* Crowdsource Tracking (similar to tile) if out of range and another TrackR user gets close to it, will help locate it on your phone
* Ring misplaced item 
* Easy replaceable battery 


### CONS: 
* $25/£25 maybe a little overpriced for target users
* The application doesn’t always give accurate information regarding items location
* Too short range (because of bluetooth?)
* The ring tone is quiet, customers complain not being to hear even if nearby
* Complains about Short battery life
* Bluetooth not encrypted (?) therefore privacy issues which average person may not encounter

### What can be improved?
* Decrease the price range perhaps.
* Increase ring volume 
* Use a bigger battery 
* Fix privacy problems


## [Estimote beacons](https://estimote.com/)

* [Reviews on Lemberg](http://blog.lemberg.co.uk/ibeacon-pros-and-cons-where-begin-programming)

### What is it?
Beacons: low energy short range bluetooth transmitter that push notifications to mobile devices that have a designated app for the location.

Anybody has a certain app on devices, whenever they come near these devices(beacons) they get a notification, allows to authenticate presence, send contextual notifications, display proximity-based content

### PROS  
* Notifies whenever client enters/leaves the tagged  zone (with a beacon) 
	* Allows to authenticate presence
	* Send contextual notifications, 
	* Display proximity-based content
* Fairly easy to implement
Low energy consumption (approximately 2 years)

### CONS: 
* Safety, once user approves opening of a beacon group, they will open without restrictions.
* Cannot determine the exact location of the user.


## CONCLUSIONS: 
The competing products have advantages as well a disadvantages. We can learn from the customers complains and try to improve the user experience from those. For example one core issue is privacy. A problem that more or less all the above products have. 

As Hussein suggested: “privacy may be a concern but we can leverage this as our USP (Unique Selling Point) all data (names, location of items and other personal data) is stored locally on the phone/watch, which means it’s not on the cloud and can easily be encrypted.”

Also a solution regarding battery life, as many don’t seem to be long lasting.
