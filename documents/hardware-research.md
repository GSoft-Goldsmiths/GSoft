## Bluetooth Component module
Bluetooth has established itself as the wireless communication standard of choice to connect wearable devices to smartphones, tablets or PCs, 

The SESUB-PAN-D14580 module, which is based on TDK's SESUB (semiconductor embedded in substrate) integration technology, features an embedded DA14580 Bluetooth 4.1 chip from Dialog Semiconductor. All terminals of the discrete chip are available, allowing full use of chip functions

The module features an integrated DC-DC converter. With a voltage supply of 3.0 V, its current consumption is only 5.0 mA when transmitting, 5.4 mA when receiving and 0.8 µA in standby mode. 

The ultra-compact dimensionsTDK SESUB-PAN-D14580 module are just 3.5 mm x 3.5 mm x 1.0 mm.

### Main features and benefits

* Ultra compact module dimensions of 3.5 mm x 3.5 mm x 1.0 mm (typical) drastically reduces the mounting footprint to only about 12 mm2
* Easy implementation of Bluetooth connectivity
* Integrated DC-DC converter

## Active RFID tag

Active RFID systems have three essential parts – a reader or interrogator, antenna, and a tag. Active RFID tags possess their own power source – an internal battery that enables them to have extremely long read ranges as well as large memory banks.

Typically, active RFID tags are powered by a battery that will last between 3 – 5 years
Essentially, two different types of active RFID tags are available – transponders and beacons.

### Transponders
In a system that uses an active transponder tag, the reader (like passive systems) will send a signal first, and then the active transponder will send a signal back with the relevant information. Transponder tags are very efficient because they conserve battery life when the tag is out of range of the reader. Active RFID transponders are commonly used in secure access control and in toll booth payment systems.

### Beacons
In a system that uses an active beacon tag, the tag will not wait to hear the reader’s signal. Instead, true to its name, the tag will ‘beacon’, or send out its specific information every 3 – 5 seconds. Beacon tags are very common in the oil and gas industry, as well as mining and cargo tracking applications. Active tag’s beacons can be read hundreds of meters away, but, in order to conserve battery life, they may be set to a lower transmit power in order to reach around 100 meters read range.

### Pros

* Extremely Long Read Range
* Increased tag abilities with partnered technologies (GPS, sensors, etc.)
* Extremely Rugged tag options

## IBeacon Technology (Bluetooth Low Energy Tags)

### Accessibility
With smartphones primarily acting as receivers, beacons form a highly accessible indoor location technology.

Pros: The capability of beacons to allow smartphones to primarily act as the receivers, makes it a highly accessible location technology

Cons:Beacons once installed need to be checked regularly for battery levels, making this less practical.

### Range
Beacons typically have a wireless range of 1m to 70m

Pros: Beacons typically have a wireless range of 1m to 70 m

### Accuracy
Beacons being radio transmitters are not very accurate as they stand the chance of interference, as radio signals can be absorbed by different media, such as water, air, human bodies or even metallic surfaces
Cons: Beacons being radio transmitters are prone to suffer from interference

### Security

Pros: No intrinsic security risks. Since beacons are primarily proximity detection devices that broadcast outbound signals, there is no inherent security risk in the transmission.

Cons: The Signals sent out by beacons can be intercepted and used by hackers. Most manufacturers have built in countermeasures that attempt to counter this.

### Cost 

While beacons by themselves are relatively cheap (a typical beacon would cost you anywhere between £5 to £50), the number of beacons required depends on the size of the space and range needed. The cost of beacon system depends on several other factors such as app and integration cost, licensing and data service cost. 


## Side note – Bluetooth 5

Although I don’t believe Bluetooth 5 is currently established, I’m going to include these notes. The Bluetooth 5 update will bring:
* 4x the range
* 2x the speed
* 800% more broadcast messaging capacity
