# Project tasks

Our group is driven in order to develop, and complete this project that we have embarked on. In order to reach the completion of the project, we have set weekly tasks that are reasonable to complete in the due set of time. The process, is a slow and content approach as we want to put forward our best piece of work each time we are set a task, as at the end it will help us achieve our main goal. As projects require human resource, sometimes this lacks and therefore effective communication has helped keep our group on top of work. We know that certain tasks have to be done at the given due date, however others can have a slight amount of leverage or residue. Tasks are categorised and set each time our group meets up, usually once a week as a team. We emphasise on the major task, first. The task that will require the most input of ones time and is a huge contribute to the end result of our project. Other tasks we divide amongst ourselves, documentations that will just help us get an understanding of the market basically an overall business perspective. Contently this comes in stages, when achieving a task or stage of a project, we count this as a milestone. A step closer to the initial outcome we have imagined. However it is also a building point, something we can look back into if required. It gives us the common ground, that if we ever come to a halt, we have a stage where we can look back at and proceed back up from that point of time. 

The sub tasks are straight forward, usually requiring an individuals amount of time and dedication to get it done. However, as a group all sub tasks are then read by the team, allowing them to put forward or add any input that they have. Every document is saved on the google documents format and then uploaded at our project hub, Trello. Deadlines set, are done in a order which the time given to get it done is achievable. Most times, we allow a one day gap which is a recovery period or that day is where members of the team can look at the uploaded task. Most sub tasks don't have much of an influence on the project, all of this just helps us identify the basics of how a business/start-up starts. Certain tasks however will be more useful in the near future as it might contribute to a major task. All the sub tasks are allowing us to see is to gain knowledge and overall understanding of the market and specifics of the product. The subs tasks that have been currently carried out have been. 

* Stakeholders Report- This document gave us a brief understanding of who are interested in the product. Giving us a more of a purpose to accomplish this project.

* Identifying the product- We needed to know, how we can make this product most suitable for the users. In terms of battery life, what kind of alert it will give off, etc. This will later be used to enhance our project and alter as a major task. 

* Market Research- We needed to identify any competitor that we had, how we will differentiate our product against theirs but also how to succeed in places they have not. This links into the document above, as the market research has helped in the discussion of identifying our product.  

* Persona- This task, allowed us to make a track of customers we suspect will purchase our products. With this we are able to see the type of people our customers are, it allowed us to make decisions regarding our product, based on this made up data.  

More so ever, our approach to major tasks are completely different. Even though some sub tasks might contribute to a major task. We know that, these tasks have a direct share in giving us a visual and understanding of what and how we will release this product.
