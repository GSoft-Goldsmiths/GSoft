# Project tasks

Our group is driven in order to develop, and complete this project that we have embarked on. In order to reach the completion of the project, we have set weekly tasks that are reasonable to complete in the due set of time. The process, is a slow and content approach as we want to put forward our best piece of work each time we are set a task, as at the end it will help us achieve our main goal. As projects require human resource, sometimes this lacks and therefore effective communication has helped keep our group on top of work. We know that certain tasks have to be done at the given due date, however others can have a slight amount of leverage or residue. Tasks are categorised and set each time our group meets up, usually once a week as a team. We emphasise on the major task, first. The task that will require the most input of ones time and is a huge contribute to the end result of our project. Other tasks we divide amongst ourselves, documentations that will just help us get an understanding of the market basically an overall business perspective. Contently this comes in stages, when achieving a task or stage of a project, we count this as a milestone. A step closer to the initial outcome we have imagined. However it is also a building point, something we can look back into if required. It gives us the common ground, that if we ever come to a halt, we have a stage where we can look back at and proceed back up from that point of time. 

## Sub tasks

The **sub tasks** are straight forward, usually requiring an individuals amount of time and dedication to get it done. However, as a group all sub tasks are then read by the team, allowing them to put forward or add any input that they have. Every document is saved on the google documents format and then uploaded at our project hub, Trello. Deadlines set, are done in a order which the time given to get it done is achievable. Most times, we allow a one day gap which is a recovery period or that day is where members of the team can look at the uploaded task. Most sub tasks don't have much of an influence on the project, all of this just helps us identify the basics of how a business/start-up starts. Certain tasks however will be more useful in the near future as it might contribute to a major task. All the sub tasks are allowing us to see is to gain knowledge and overall understanding of the market and specifics of the product. The subs tasks that have been currently carried out have been. 

* **Stakeholders Report**- This document gave us a brief understanding of who are interested in the product. Giving us a more of a purpose to accomplish this project.

* **Identifying the product**- We needed to know, how we can make this product most suitable for the users. In terms of battery life, what kind of alert it will give off, etc. This will later be used to enhance our project and alter as a major task. 

* **Market Research**- We needed to identify any competitor that we had, how we will differentiate our product against theirs but also how to succeed in places they have not. This links into the document above, as the market research has helped in the discussion of identifying our product.

* **Persona**- This task, allowed us to make a track of customers we suspect will purchase our products. With this we are able to see the type of people our customers are, it allowed us to make decisions regarding our product, based on this made up data.

More so ever, our approach to major tasks are completely different. Even though some sub tasks might contribute to a major task. We know that, these tasks have a direct share in giving us a visual and understanding of what and how we will release this product. 


## Major Tasks

More so ever, our approach to **major tasks** are completely different. Even though some sub tasks might contribute to a major task. We know that, these tasks have a direct share in giving us a visual and understanding of what and how we will release this product. Mentioned before major tasks requires the most man hours. This is where quality has to be assured. Anything that is missed out when completing these tasks can affect the end result or will be counted as time lost. As we might need to implement anything that was missed out on mentioning later. Current major tasks that have been worked on are. 

* **Competitors**- We extensively looked at all the current threat that are imposed to our group, we wanted to differentiate our product from any existing ones. We not only looked at what the competitors provide but also what technology they are or are likely using. This could link to our project as we can improve the technology previously used, or it could just be one of the many extra features that our product will carry. 

* **Hardware**- As a group we had to summarise all the hardware that will possibly required to move onto the conceptual prototype and eventually the functional product. Looking at previous documentations such as the competitors, but also extra research has allowed us to pick out all the hardware that we need to gather to move forward. 

* **Clientele**- Working on the market research allowed us to see and identify key aspects of the project. Members of the group provided an online questionnaire to different people with in the university but also family outside of university to make the data more reliable. This allowed us to target a wide range of people to get a broad understanding of all of our potential clients. We also did a questionnaire for what the name of the group should be as we believe a suitable name with help market the product. This also helped us decide the features which people want the product to include. 

* **Conceptual prototype**- This is a prototype of the device, something that we will put together to see the potential to which we can then develop this into a working product. At this stage, we will experiment the different ways to which we can put together our product. 

* **Functional product**- Creating a conceptual prototype will help the team to assemble a functional product. All that has to be done, is put the conceptual product together to get it working as a functional product.


## Milestones

**Milestones** are the most important part of putting together any group project. Timing has to be precise to achieve each milestone. Milestones are building blocks in any project as it is a stage of the project that has been accomplished. The milestones are given a future date in which we want that milestone to be completed. The milestones of our project are: 

* **Proposal** (December 12th)- The first milestone is to be able to put all the information that has been completed together and present it as one document. This will contain all the required details on the project to move on to the further stages. 

* **Software Development Prototype** (January 7th)- Finished with the proposal, we will start on completing the software elements of the product, this does not have to be fully functional but should be a replica of what the end product might be. 

* **Presentation** to prospective employers (January 11th)- We are given the opportunity to present to future employers who will be working in the computer science field. Presenting will help us gain confidence that will be used when we apply for jobs. Furthermore, we gain intel from the employers as they will give us their opinions on our service and product. This is knowledge that can be taken into consideration to improve our project as we are only presenting the prototype. 

* **Software Development Finish** (March 5th)- After the presentation to prospective employers, taking all the feedback received, as a group we will then create a final product.

* **Presentation** (March 9th)- This presentation will be us presenting the final developed product. How the product works, what it can do, costs, etc. 

* **Final Report** (March 21st)- The final project should outline everything put together into one essay. How each milestone were achieved, any obstacles that came in the way. The overall experience and anything learnt will be mentioned in the final project.
