# 10.Conclusion
As established by our survey and research by Mozy, we believe the loss of personal belongings in various places is a common, daily life problem for majority of people.

Our solution to this problem is a tracker that works at short and long range, which the user can interact through a mobile application to keep track of an item. Other products on the market, don't provide a short and long range tracker, or a tracker that adapts to the user. 

From our survey, we predict a majority of target users will be individuals who are always on the move and active, such as students, office workers who many times need to travel abroad. 

Prototyping with different technologies we concluded that only one type of technology wouldn’t meet our concept prototype; therefore, we sought a hybrid solution. A combination of Bluetooth at short range and cellular at long range.

We recognise our product may raise privacy concerns. To address this a ‘terms of use’ script will be ensuring consumers that their data and location will be used for the sole purpose of retrieving items or help them prevent losing them. In order that our product satisfies all our use cases, we will have to experiment and test the UI of our product as well as the underlying physical architecture.

As of now, the lack of resources and expertise are limiting us to build a more portable physical device. We hope to deliver an upgraded version of the device in future after conducting further research on our concept, following the development of the working prototype.
