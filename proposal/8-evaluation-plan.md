# Evaluation Plan

## Intro
Due to the fact that our product includes both hardware and software, we will have to test both aspects during and post development.

## Hardware
As to the hardware, the main concern was the general size of the tracker and whether it can easily be an extension to the users’ personal items. 

The test cases during development are as follows;
-	Give users a mock tracker which match the dimensions of our actual tracker and then survey them as to how they feel about the size.
-	Allow users to use the mock tracker for a week or so to determine whether they could get used to the size.
-	Allow the user to try out different methods of attaching the tracker be it using a key ring, Velcro or adhesives and asses which they find the most convenient.

The test cases post-development could be to redo the above tests and allow the users to see the effectiveness of the software and see whether the extension is worthwhile as previously they didn’t have their opinions weighed up against the actual use of the tracker.


## Software
As to the software, the main concerns are the effectiveness of the Bluetooth and also the effectiveness of the cellular and whether they can withstand extreme measures.

The test cases during development are as follows;
-	We will test the notification a user receives in multiple scenarios such as a loud club, a library and at home and see whether the notification is adequate to grab the users’ attention.
-	We will test the accuracy of the distance the Bluetooth trackers tells the user by thoroughly testing different locations.
-	We will test the ability of the hologram to triangulate the location in areas with poor cellular signal.
-	We will also test its ability to give a location within a radius of 10m.

The test cases post development will have to be more thorough so we can identify bugs and typical usage problems early in the beta stage before we push the first version and thus assure quality of the product is maintained and optimal.
