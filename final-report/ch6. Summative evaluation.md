SUMMATIVE EVALUATION

DESCRIBE THE 9 COMPLETED TASKS OF THE SOFTWARE UP TO DATE

Since the beginning our software has been designed for individuals who are always in the run and are prone to leave or loose items behind but also for who simply would like to keep track of objects.
While developing the software we made sure of it being as user friendly as possible. With an informative welcome screen and an overall simple, clear, easy to navigate user interface has made this possible. 
Users can easily log items of interest by naming them and also add a picture related to these if they wish to, making it fairly easy to understand the kind of item logged. 
Multiple objects can be logged in the app; whenever a new one is paired to the app it will be added to a list of items. Of course details of these can be altered or updated at a later time, if the user wishes to.
From the beginning, one of our main goals for the software part of our project was to have the ability to track any tagged items. 
We have made progress from the beginning, as now our application is able to display the item and user’s location in a map format with a simple tap of a finger! 
Whenever connection is granted and the phones location service is on, consumers can navigate to the last known location of the item using AppleMap as the app is linked to it.




Navigate to tagged item:

App should link to Apple Map to navigate User to Item's last location.
