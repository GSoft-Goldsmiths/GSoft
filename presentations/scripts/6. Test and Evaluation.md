### Mobile app testing (iOS/Android) 

[i dont know how to did this, front end team knows best about this]

- Methodology

- Evaluation



### Tracker testing

Internet of things project, we did not use any automated testing.

Started with a raspberry pi 3 before downgrading the size to a raspberry pi zero, both have the same operating system. So, testing didn’t have to be replicated and time saved.

Implemented features by testing then evaluating in terms of fulfilling user needs if this works or this doesn’t. 

we were narrowing our options down all the time (lots of options for Bluetooth tracking puck, estimote etc..). Own Python server to bash scripts SDK based server example, puck.js & estimote.. [talk about quick examples]

If something didn’t work while testing, it was discarded.

We didn’t test server load of amazon s3, however used so widely and is guaranteed to be scalable.
Physical tracker also needs physical testing, battery life drain, drop test, extreme use case testing.
