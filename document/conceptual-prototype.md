# Conceptual Prototype

## Concept
Our solution is to prevent the users from forgetting their belongings, and it is not possible to make the interviewees actually forget something and leave it behind. In order to so setup test the valuation from the users, we set up the scenario and let them evaluate and test the feasibility of our idea. The most important part of our solution is to make sure the users can notice the notification whenever their belongs are far away from them, so the valuation focus on the feasibility of the notification.

## Conceptual Scenario & Methods
We choose four places to test that will the users notice the notification, a nightclub, a classroom in the university and a platform of an overground station, a student hall as a home, where most of our interviews lost their items. The interviewees are the two students from the Goldsmiths, University of London, who are more similar to our persona.

During the interviews, we ask the interviewees stay either at the entrance or inside and keep the mobile we provide in somewhere they usually put. The sensor is mocked by a key fob and attach to their bag as the tracking item, then we ask them to leave one of their belonging few meters away. We send a text message to that mobile as a notification prototype which says that they might have something left behind. When the mobile receives the message, it either uses the sound or vibration to test different approaches of notification the users.

## Valuations
In our interviews, most of the interviews can notice the notification in the hall room and corridor on the campus, but not necessarily notice the notification with at the entrance of the nightclub or the platform of the overground station. However, a constant ringing and vibration can be definitely noticed on the platform. To get the awareness of the interviews in the nightclub is not workable, but it works when the interviewees are at the entrance where is relatively quieter.

In most of the cases, the interviewees can be notified by the notification, and the constant ringing and vibration can definitely make it works in most
