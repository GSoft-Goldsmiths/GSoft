## Privacy

It is widely know that privacy issue is a big concern when it comes to mobile application development. According to the Pew Research Center, “54% of app users have decided to not install a cell phone app when they discovered how much personal information they would need to share in order to use it”. Our service as a item tracking system, geolocation is one of the sensitive but useful data which help to improve on our service.

If we decide to collect the personal data while users use the service, our team need to do the following things to avoid any legal concern:

1. Register with ICO to become a “data controller” who determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are, or are to be, processed.  
2. If we rent a cloud service, we need to sign a contract with them as a “data processor” who processes the data on behalf of the data controller.
3. If any personal data is to be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we will have to demonstrate that there will be adequate protection for it.
4. Inform the users that what personal data will be collected and what how does system use the data.

Also we should follow the suggestions from ICO as well:

1. Collect and process the minimum data necessary, don’t collect the unnecessary data for future usage.
2. Don’t store the personal data longer than is necessary for the usage.
3. User should have the right to delete the personal data permanently at anytime, only make an exception if we are legally obliged to keep the data.
4. Collect the data for bug report by using anonymous data or with informed consent from the user.
