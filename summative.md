# SUMMATIVE EVALUATION
**DESCRIBE THE 9 COMPLETED TASKS OF THE SOFTWARE UP TO DATE**
Since the beginning, our software has been designed for individuals who are always in the
run and are prone to leave or loose items behind but also for who simply would like to keep track of objects. 
While developing the software we made sure of it being as user friendly as possible.
With an informative welcome screen and an overall simple, clear, easy to navigate user interface has made this possible. 
Users can easily log items of interest by naming them and also add a picture related to these if they wish to, 
making it fairly easy to understand the kind of item logged. Multiple objects can be logged, which will be available 
in a page where they’ll be listed.
